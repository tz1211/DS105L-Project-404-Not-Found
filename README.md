# DS105L-Project-404-Not-Found
## Description 
The purpose of this project is to try and create a machine learning algorithm that draws on past NBA data as well as media data to predict the outcome of the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. 
## Data Sources 
- NBA.com 
- BasketballReference.com 
- BBC.com 
## Team Members
